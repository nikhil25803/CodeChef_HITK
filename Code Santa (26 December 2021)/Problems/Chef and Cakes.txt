Chef and Cakes 
Problem Code: CCAKESSolvedSubmit (Practice)

This Christmas, Chef has an amazing idea he wants to distribute cakes in his locality. 
But, being the choosy person he is , he only wants to distribute cakes of one specific flavour.

In his locality, there is a cake shop that has N cakes arranged in an array A such that each flavour is represented a specific number. 
For example, one such possible arrangement of array A is [1,1,3,2,2,2,4] , where each number represents a specific flavour.

But at first, Chef wants to know which cake he should buy,so that he can reach maximum number of people. 
Now, since he is a very busy person, he asked his best friend i.e you for help. You need to find out which flavour has the maximum number of cakes in the cake shop.

Note: If there are multiple answers then print the flavour which is represented by the largest number among them.

Input Format
The first line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase will contain N - the length of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output a single number representing the flavour that has maximum number of cakes in the cake shop.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤A[i]≤109

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
