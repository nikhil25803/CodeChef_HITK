Christmas Factor 
Problem Code: CFACTOR

Christmas is finally here! Since the children have been stuck in their homes for the past two years.
Santa Claus decided to play a fun game with them.

Santa will give the children N integers A1,A2,...,AN and the children have to find the smallest positive number greater than 1.
Such that the GCD of that number with each of the N integers is 1.

GCD of two positive integers a and b is equal to the biggest integer d such that both integers a and b are divisible by d.

Input Format
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N.
The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.

Output Format
For each test case, print the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that gives GCD equal to 1 with each of the elements of A.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤A[i]≤106

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
