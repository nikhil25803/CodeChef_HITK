Santa and Gifts 
Problem Code: SGIFT


Santa Claus monitors every child throughout the year and prepares a goodness level for each child. 
There are N children in the city of Rovaniemi and the goodness level of each of them is given by an array A.

Santa Claus decided to give the i th child B[i] coins. 
He is very impartial so he should give the most number of coins to the child with the highest goodness level.

More formally, if two children have the same goodness level, then they must receive the same number of coins. 
If one of the children has a greater goodness level, then that child should receive more coins than the child with a lesser goodness level.

Let K be the number of ways in which Santa can distribute the coins among the N children. 
You need to print the value of K. Since K can be large, output K modulo (109+7).

Also, print the array B such that the number of coins spent by Santa is maximum.

Input Format
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N.
The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N

Output Format
For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the value of K modulo (109+7).

In the second line, output N integers denoting the array B such that the number of coins spent by Santa is maximum.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤A[i]≤109
1≤B[i]≤N

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

3 3 3 

Explanation
Test case 1: The only possible way in which Santa can distribute the coins is [1,2,3]. So, the total number of ways is 1.
Test case 2: The possible ways in which Santa can distribute the coins are [1,1,1], [2,2,2] and [3,3,3]. 
So, the total number of ways is 3. Of these, the distribution in which Santa spends the maximum number of coins is [3,3,3].
