Santas Lost Map

Just like every Christmas, Santa is planning to deliver gifts for all the kids around the world.

While searching for the coordinates of all the houses he needs to visit, Santa realized he has forgotten to get the coordinates of one city altogether!

Now Santa is distressed. Cause all he has is a N×M grid A full of 0s and 1s where the 1s represent a block of a house and 0s are non-residential places. 
Now, no two houses are four directionally adjacent meaning a group of adjacent 1s represents a single house only. 
It is to be noted that all the houses in the grid are either square or rectangular in shape.

Now, it's your job to find the coordinates. 
In Santa’s coordinate system, a house can be represented such that the top left corner of the house is (x1,y1) and the bottom right corner is (x2,y2). 
Each house should be represented like a 4 integer array i.e [x1,y1,x2,y2].

Your work is to give him the number of houses you have found followed by the space-separated, 4 number coordinates of each of them, each printed in a new line. 
The houses must be sorted row-wise by their top left corner.

In case you didn't find any house on the map, print −1.

Note: The input and output files are large, so use fast input-output methods.

Input Format
First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M.
The next N lines contain M space-separated integers representing the grid A.

Output Format
For each test case,

The first line of output is the number of houses you have found.
From the second line onwards, print the 4 integer array [x1,y1,x2,y2] of each house, each of them should be printed in a new line. 
The houses must be sorted row-wise by their top left corner.
Print −1 if you don't find any house on the map.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤M,N≤1000
0≤A[i]≤1

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of M×N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

All the houses are either square or rectangular in shape.

Explanation
For the first test case, we can see that the number of houses on the grid is 2. 
The first one starts at top left corner of the grid i.e (0,0) and ends at the same place itself. 
Therefore the coordinates are [0,0,0,0]. For the second house, it starts from the coordinate (1,1) and ends at (2,2). 
Hence the coordinates of the second house is [1,1,2,2]. Since (0,0) comes before (1,1) in row-wise traversal, so we print [0,0,0,0] before [1,1,2,2].
