CHEFFIN TEMPERATURE 
Problem Code: CTEMP

Wizard wants to record the temperature of all her magical potions. 
But they don’t measure temperature in the scales known to us. 
Instead, they follow this secret formula :

Temperature in Cheffin = (Temperature in Celsius/27) + ((Temperature in Fahrenheit − 23)/9) + (Temperature in Kelvin − 72)
Temperature in Kelvin = Temperature in Celsius + 273
Temperature in Fahrenheit = ((Temperature in Celsius)∗9)/5 + 32
The thermometer which Wizard has brought from earth gives temperature in celsius. 
Can you help Wizard calculate the temperature of all the potions in Cheffin?

INPUT
First line has a single integer T followed by T lines having 1 integer each.

OUTPUT
For each test case print the temperature in Cheffin ROUNDED to nearest integer.

CONSTRAINTS
1≤T≤105
−106≤temperature≤106

SAMPLE INPUT
3
40
-40
-737

SAMPLE OUTPUT
251 
153
-710

EXPLANATION
We are given 2 temperatures in celsius. So we convert it to Fahrenheit and kelvin using our knowledge and put it in the secret formula to get the answer in Cheffin.
