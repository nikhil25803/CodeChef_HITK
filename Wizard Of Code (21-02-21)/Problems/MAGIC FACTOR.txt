MAGIC FACTOR 
Problem Code: MAGFACT


You have your first-class test in your course “Magic 101”. 
The test is obviously online due to the pandemic, but you decide to attempt the test honestly, unlike other students of your class. 
The task is as follows.

You are given a list of n words consisting of small English alphabet letters. 
Every word has a value which is the sum of values of each letter of the word. (For eg: 'a'=1, 'b'=2, etc). 
There is a new term called Magic factor for a pair of words. 
The magic factor of 2 words having value v1 & v2 is = abs(v1−v2).

Your task is, every time you encounter a word, you have to calculate its magic factor with the last word you encountered of the same length. 
Finally, print the total sum of all magic factors calculated.

Note that once you use some index for the magic factor calculation, you can't use that index again.

Input
The first line of each test case contains one integer n.
Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output
For each test case, Print x, the total sum of magic factors for each test case.

Constraint
1≤ n≤ 2∗105
1≤ |s|≤ 2∗105

It is guaranteed that the sum of the length of all words in each test case does not exceed 2∗105.

Sample Input:
5
aa
aaaa
aaaaaa
abcd
zz

Sample Output:
56

Sample Explanation
The pairs for the calculation will be : [aa,zz],[aaaa,abcd]
So, Total sum = |2−52|+|4−10|=56
Note that aaaaa didn't match any other word.
