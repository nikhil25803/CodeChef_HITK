WIZARD AND ARRAYS 
Problem Code: WAND

Wizard has an array of integers named a. He has to find out the bitwise-AND of all the pairs of elements of the array. 
Before carrying out the operation, he wants to make sure that he has just enough bits to store the answer of the AND operations. 
Can you help Wizard in finding the minimum number of bits that he needs to have to store the answer of the bitwise−AND of any two numbers of the array?

INPUT FORMAT:
First argument is the integer “t” denoting the no. of test cases
First argument of each test case is integer “n” the size of the input array
Next line consists of n space separated integers of array a.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the minimum no. of bits Wizard needs to have to store the answer of the AND operation of any two elements.

Constraints:
1≤t≤105
1≤n≤105
0≤a[i]≤109 It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn’t exceed 10^6.

SAMPLE INPUT:

0

Explanation
In the first case (1 & 2), (1 & 3), (2 & 3) are respectively 0, 1 and 2 and a minimum of 2 bits is required to represent any of them.
