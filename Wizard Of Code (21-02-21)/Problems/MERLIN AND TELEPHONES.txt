The ministry of welfare wants that each telephone in the city is directly connected to b other telephones in the same city.

You are given that one wire can connect only 2 different telephones. 
Help Merlin find the minimum number of wires required to complete the order. 
If order fulfillment is not possible, simply print −1.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers a,b.

Output:
For each test case print only one integer that is the number of wires required. If not possible, simply print −1.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
0≤a,b≤109

Sample Input:
1
5 2

Sample Output:
5

EXPLANATION:
For the first test case there are 5 telephones in the city and the ministry wants each telephone to be connected to 2 other telephones. If telephone 1 is connected with 2 and 5, telephone 2 is connected with 1 and 3, telephone 3 is connected to 4 and 2, telephone 4 is connected to 3 and 5 and telephone 5 is connected to 1 and 4.
